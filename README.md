# react-2048
Classic 2048 built from scratch using React.
Live [here](http://shogunsea.com/2048/)

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have `yarn` and `gulp` installed globally.
Note that due to [the way](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22115400/why-do-we-need-to-install-gulp-globally-and-locally) `gulp` works, you need to have it installed both gloabally and locally.

## Install dependencies
`gulp setup`

## Build and bundle assets
`gulp buid`

## Run the app
Dev mode hot reloading: `npm run dev`

Dev mode hot reloading and debugger mode: `npm run dev-debug`

Run in production mode(spawn new process in background, no stdout output): `npm start`
